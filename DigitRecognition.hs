-- All undefined values and functions should be completed. Your code will compile and test 
-- (with the -- test flag) even if some functions are left undefined.

--                                          Type Aliases
-- These type aliases help to abstract our code. You will use them extensively in DigitRecognition.hs
--
type PixelImage = [[Bool]] 
-- A pixel image is a two-dimensional list of booleans.
-- False represents an empty pixel, and True a grey or black pixel. Each pixel image will be 28x28.
type Feature = Int
-- Each pixel location is considered a separate feature for classification. Because the image is
-- 28x28, there are 784 total features.
type Digit = Integer
-- Each image is of a specific digit, 0 through 9. To distinguish the labels or guesses from
-- other numbers, we use a type alias.


--                                      Primitive Functions
-- These functions will be used in your implementation of the classifier. Be
-- sure you understand how they are used, but you do not have to understand how they work.
--

--hasFeature checks if an image has a specific feature: i.e. if that pixel is white or blank.
--
--This encapsulates the ugliness of storing images as nested lists. Notice the normally
--forbidden use of !!. This suggests that there should be a better way to handle and process
--images. For the purposes of this project we will accept this.  We can take reassurance that
--lists of length 28 are so short that better storage methods are probably unnecessary.
hasFeature :: PixelImage -> Feature -> Bool
hasFeature img ftr = 
    let dim = length img
        row = img !! (ftr `div` dim)
        pixel = row !! (ftr `mod` dim)
    in pixel
-- Example:    img `hasFeature` ftr

--outOf wraps around Haskell's built-in Rational data type. Rationals store fractional values
--precisely, with no possibility of underflow. Internally, the numerator and denominator are
--kept as Integers, which have no maximum outside the space limitations of computer memory. You
--will use this function to return an estimated probability. 
outOf :: Int -> Int -> Rational
outOf a b =  (fromIntegral a) % (fromIntegral b)

-- showPixelImage should take a PixelImage and turn it into a single string.
-- Since we have lost gray colors (see readPixelImage in Framework.hs), our
-- string will have '#' for black pixels, and ' ' for white pixels.
--
-- I suggest a helper function that takes an individual row of a pixel image and turns it into a
-- string. You can then use the built-in (unlines) function, which takes a list of strings and
-- turns them into a single string, separated by newline.
-- 
-- Example: showPixelImage [[True, True], [True, False]]
--          "##\n# \n"

-- lookupVal takes a key of type a, an association list from a to b, and returns the hopefully
-- unique value associated with the key. If lst contains the tuple (k, v), then 
-- lookupVal k lst should return v.
--
-- Full Credit - Implementation Details:
--   For full credit, ensure that the key matches exactly one tuple in the list. If not, throw an
--   error.
-- Remember: work on full credit until after you've completed the core project!
-- 
-- Example: lookupVal 'b' [('a', 8), ('b', 7), ('c', 9)]
--          7

-- A corpus is an association list between digits and the images that are labeled with that
-- digit. By storing the information this way, we avoid the frequent computation of which images
-- are labeled with which digit. 
type Corpus = [(Digit, [PixelImage])]

-- When we read in the files, we get a list of image-label tuples. It is far more efficient to
-- group the images by their label as a Corpus. buildCorpus takes the list of tuples and
-- separates it into sub-lists for each label. Order does not matter, either of the digits or of
-- the images associated with each digit.
--
-- I suggest a helper function that takes a digit and returns the list of all images labeled with
-- that digit.
--
-- Full Credit - Implementation Details:
--    For full credit, only create entries in the Corpus for digits that actually have associated
--    images. You might need to use the (nub) function, which returns the set version of a list
--    (i.e.  all duplicate elements have been removed). 
--    Your function must still run quickly!
-- Remember: work on full credit after you've completed the core project!

--imgC = [[False, True]]

-- classifyImage should return the most likely digit, based on the rank computed by rankOfDigit.

-- Extra Style - Implementation Details:
--   Once you have smoothing working, the ideal implementation will check that the maximum rank is
--   greater than 0. If it is not, you should print an error message. However, you will get errors
--   until smoothing is working correctly, so don't insert that check until then!
